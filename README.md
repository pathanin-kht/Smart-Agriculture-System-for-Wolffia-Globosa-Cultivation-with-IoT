# Smart Agriculture System for Wolffia Globosa Cultivation with IoT

## Overview
This project develops a smart agriculture system for cultivating *Wolffia globosa* using IoT technology. The goal is to help farmers in the Northeastern region of Thailand manage and monitor the environmental conditions of their *Wolffia globosa* cultivation efficiently. The system utilizes IoT technology to monitor temperature, humidity, gas levels, water turbidity, and the quality of *Wolffia globosa* via ESP32 cameras and OpenCV.

## Features
- **Temperature and Humidity Control**: Uses sensors to monitor temperature and humidity for optimal growth of *Wolffia globosa*.
- **Water Quality Monitoring**: Monitors the turbidity of water to prevent water spoilage.
- **Gas Sensor**: Uses an MQ135 to monitor harmful gases such as ammonia that could harm the growth of *Wolffia globosa*.
- **Wolffia globosa Quality Monitoring**: Uses ESP32 Camera and OpenCV to analyze and count the number of *Wolffia globosa* to assess their health.
- **Real-time Notifications**: The system sends notifications through a website if any abnormalities are detected in the environment.
- **Prediction System**: Implements RNN-LSTM model to forecast environmental changes like temperature and humidity.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: ESP32, DHT11, MQ135, Water Turbidity Sensor, ESP32 Camera
- **Software**: Python, Flask API, Firebase, OpenCV, RNN-LSTM

## Example
### It's a Test Case for OpenCV to analyze and count the number of Wolffia globosa.
> **Note:** The code is currently under development.
